# Deployment of a FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) Cluster on the Azure with Terraform
## Introduction
### This topology is only recommended for using with FOS 7.0.5 and later, since FSO 7.0 3 ports only HA setup is supported.
* port1 - hamgmt/hasync
* port2 - public/untrust
* port3 - private/trust

A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM Cluster on Azure

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0

## License
- The terms for the FortiGate PAYG or BYOL image in the Azure Marketplace needs to be accepted once before usage. This is done automatically during deployment via the Azure Portal. For the Azure CLI the commands below need to be run before the first deployment in a subscription.
  - BYOL
`az vm image terms accept --publisher fortinet --offer fortinet_fortigate-vm_v5 --plan fortinet_fg-vm`
  - PAYG
`az vm image terms accept --publisher fortinet --offer fortinet_fortigate-vm_v5 --plan fortinet_fg-vm_payg_2022`

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - Azure Virtual Network with 3 subnets
   - Two FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) instances with three NICs.
   - Two firewall rules.
   - A Ubuntu Client instance.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

ActiveMGMTPublicIP = <Active FGT Management Public IP>
ClusterPublicIP = <Cluster Public IP>
PassiveMGMTPublicIP = <Passive FGT Management Public IP>
Password = <FGT Password>
ResourceGroup = <Resource Group>
Username = <FGT admin>
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
