# Deployment of a FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) Cluster on the Azure with Terraform
## Introduction
### This topology is only recommended for using with FOS 7.0.5 and later, since FSO 7.0 3 ports only HA setup is supported.
* port1 - hamgmt/hasync
* port2 - public/untrust
* port3 - private/trust
* port4 - sdwan/advpn

A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM Cluster on Azure

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:

1 x in region A (default FranceCentral) as HUB A with a cluster of fortigates:
   - Azure Virtual Network (vnet) with 4 subnets as hub vnet (subnets: mgmt-ha, public, private and advpn).
   - Two vnets as spoke peered with firewall vnet (vnet-spoke-1, vnet-spoke-2). Spoke-2 route table is updated by Fortinet SDN-Connector and Spoke-1 route table is updated by Azure Route Server BGP peered with fortigate cluster. 
   - Two FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) instances with four NICs in HA active/passive (default PAYG)
   - Firewalls rules to allow traffic E-W spokes, E-W spoke-onprem, N-S spoke-public and E-W spoke sites connected with ADVPN.
   - IPSEC connections using ADVPN to on-premise firewalls (config example for on-prem device should be completed and applied manualy).
   - Two Ubuntu Client instance in spokes vnet subnets.
   - eBGP routing between on-prem spoke sites over the advpn tunnels.

1 x in region B as HUB B (default East US 2) with a cluster of fortigates:
   - Clone deployment in region A HUB A

1 x in region A as site 1 with a single fortigate instance:
   - One remote site (site1) deployed on Azure as well, acting as remote on-prem sites for testing.
   - MPLS connection (ExpressRoute) is simulated using and IPSEC tunnel against fortigate vnet using Virtual Network Gateways.
      - 1 FGT VM in each site for ADVPN to HUB
      - 1 vnet network with 3 subnets (public, private and mgmt/ha)
      - 1 vnet network with 1 subnet (subnet-spoke-1-vm) for test virtual machine peered with FGT vnet
      - 1 test vm for testing
      - Fortigate SDWAN interface overlay with IPSEC tunnels to Azure over INET and simulated MPLS underlay


## Deployment considerations:
      - Azure Route Server could take over 10min to complete
      - Virtual Netwok Gateway could take over 20min to complete
      - If "terraform apply" fails because a timeout, just apply it again and will complete the deployment. 
      - You will be charged for this deployment

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

regionA-ResourceGroup = <Resource Group Region A>
regionB-ResourceGroup = <Resource Group Region B>
za-fgt-active-mgmt-url = <Active FGT Management URL Public IP Region A>
za-fgt-passive-mgmt-url = <Passive FGT Management URL Public IP Region A>
zb-fgt-active-mgmt-url = <Active FGT Management URL Public IP Region B>
zb-fgt-passive-mgmt-url = <Passive FGT Management URL Public IP Region B>
site-fgt-mgmt-ip_url = <FGT Managemnet URL Public IP Region A>
za-TestVM-spoke-1-ip = <Spoke 1 VM IP Region A>
za-TestVM-spoke-1-ip = <Spoke 2 VM IP Region A>
zb-TestVM-spoke-1-ip = <Spoke 1 VM IP Region B>
zb-TestVM-spoke-1-ip = <Spoke 2 VM IP Region B>
TestVM-site-ip = <Test VM IP site Region A>
h_Username = <FGT user and TestVM>
i_Password = <FGT Password and TestVM>
advpn_ipsec-psk-key = <PSK for ADVPN>
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
